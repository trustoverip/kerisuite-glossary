## Introduction

The KERI Main Glossary is a deliverable of the ToIP KERI Suite Working Group. Its purpose is to promote shared understanding of terms and concepts across the many different working groups, communities, enterprises, and ecosystems who are collaborating to develop and deploy decentralized digital trust infrastructure.

Contributions and feedback are encouraged from any stakeholder in this area of terminology.

## Linking to this Glossary

This glossary is designed to be both human and machine readable. All terms are listed alphabetically; acronyms are listed separately and linked to the fully expanded terms. Document authors can link directly to any term using standard web links and anchors following this syntax:

  `https://weboftrust.github.io/kerisuite-glossary#term:xxxxx`

Where `xxxxx` is the term as it appears in the glossary, with any spaces are replaced by en-dashes (hyphens). For example, a link to the term `self-certifying identifer` would be:

  `https://weboftrust.github.io/kerisuite-glossary#self-certifiying-identifier`

A specification document written using the [Trustoverip](https://trustoverip.org)'s open source [Spec-Up-T environment](https://trustoverip.github.io/spec-up-t/) documented in the [Spec-Up-T manual](https://trustoverip.github.io/spec-up-t-website/), originally based on [Decentralized Identity Foundation](http://identity.foundation/)'s open source [Spec-Up editor](https://identity.foundation/spec-up/).

The tool may create special external references to terms in this glossary using the Spec-Up `xref` and the `tref` tags following this syntax:

  `[[xref: glossary, xxxxx]]` and   `[[tref: glossary, xxxxx]]`

  Where `glossary` is the text label the document author assigns to the URL of a Web-accessible glossary, and `xxxxx` is the term as it appears in that glossary, with any spaces are replaced by en-dashes (hyphens). For example, a Spec-Up external reference to the term `self-certifying identifer` using the label `toip` for this glossary would look like this:

  `[[xref: toip, self-certifying-identifier]]`

An item borrowed from an other glossary might look like this:

  `[[xref: vlei, OOR]]`
