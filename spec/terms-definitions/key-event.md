[[def: key-event, Key event]]

~ See the more general TrustoverIP concept of key-event: [[xref: toip1, key event]]

~ Concretely, it is the serialized data structure of an entry in the Key event log ([[ref: KEL]]) for an [AID]( [[ref: autonomic-identifier]]). Abstractly, the data structure itself. Key events come in different types and are used primarily to establish or change the [[ref: authoritative]] set of keypairs and/or anchor other data to the authoritative set of keypairs at the point in the KEL actualized by a particular entry.
