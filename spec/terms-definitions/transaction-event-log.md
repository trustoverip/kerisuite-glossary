[[def: transaction-event-log, transaction event log, TEL]]

~ The set of transactions that determine registry state form a log called a Transaction Event Log (TEL). The TEL provides a cryptographic proof of registry state by reference to the corresponding controlling [[ref: key-event-log]]. Any validator may therefore cryptographically verify the [[ref: authoritative]] of the [[ref: registry]].
