[[def: derivation-code, Derivation code]]

~ To properly extract and use the [[ref: public-key-infrastructure]] embedded in a [[ref: self-certifying-identifier]] we need to know the cryptographic _signing scheme_ used by the [[ref: key-pair]]. KERI includes this very compactly in the identifier, by replacing the pad character (a character used to fill a void to able to always end up with a fixed length public key) with a special character that encodes the derivation process. We call this the _derivation code_.
