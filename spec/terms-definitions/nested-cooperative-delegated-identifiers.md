[[def: nested-cooperative-delegated-identifiers, nested cooperative delegated identifiers]]

~ In KERI delegations are cooperative, this means that both the delegator and delegate must contribute to a delegation. The delegator creates a cryptographic commitment in either a rotation or interaction event via a seal in a delegated establishment event. The delegate creates a cryptographic commitment in its establishment event via a seal to the delegating event.
