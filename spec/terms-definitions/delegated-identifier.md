[[def: delegated-identifier, Delegated identifier]]

~ Matches the act of [[ref: delegation]] with the appropriate digital twin. Consequently when applied recursively, delegation may be used to compose arbitrarily complex trees of hierarchical (delegative) key management event streams. This is a most powerful capability that may provide an essential building block for a generic universal decentralized key management infrastructure ([[ref: DKMI]]) that is also compatible with the demand of generic event streaming applications.
