[[def: threshold-of-accountable-duplicity, Threshold of accountable duplicity, TOAD]]

~ The threshold of accountable duplicity (TOAD) is a threshold number `M` that the controller declares to accept accountability for an event when any subset `M` of the `N` witnesses confirm that event. The threshold `M` indicates the minimum number of confirming witnesses the controller deems sufficient given some number `F` of potentially faulty witnesses, given that `M >= N - F`. This enables a controller to provide itself with any degree of protection it deems necessary given this accountability.
