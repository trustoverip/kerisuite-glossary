[[def: direct-mode, direct mode]]

~ Two primary trust modalities motivated the KERI design, One of these is the _direct_ (one-to-one) mode, in which the identity controller establishes control via verified signatures of the controlling key-pair. The direct mode doesn't use witnesses nor [[ref: key-event-receipt-log]]s, but has direct (albeit intermittent) network contact with the validator.
