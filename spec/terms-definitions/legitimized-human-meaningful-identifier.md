[[def: legitimized-human-meaningful-identifier, Legitimized human-meaningful identifier, LID]]

~ An [[ref:AID]] and its associated self-certifying trust basis gives rise to a trust domain for associated cryptographically verifiable non-repudiable statements. Every other type of identifier including human meaningful identifiers may then be secured in this resultant trust domain via an [[ref:end-verifiable]] [[authorization]]. This authorization legitimizes that human meaningful identifier as an LID through its association with an AID. The result is a secured trust domain specific identifier couplet of aid|lid.
