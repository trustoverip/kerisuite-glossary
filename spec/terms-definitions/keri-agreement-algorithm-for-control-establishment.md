~ Agreement on an event in a key event log [[ref: KEL]] means each [[ref: witness]] has observed the exact version of the event and each witnessâ€™ [[ref: receipt]] has been received by every other witness.

~ Control establishment means that the set of agreeing witnesses, along with the controller of the identifier and associated keypairs, create a verifiable way to establish control authority for an identifier by reading all of the events in the KEL that have been agreed upon by the witnesses and the controller.
