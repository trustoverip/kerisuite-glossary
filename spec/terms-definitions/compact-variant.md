[[def: compact-variant, Compact variant]]

~ Either a [[ref: most-compact]] version of an ACDC or the [[ref: fully-compact]] version of an ACDC. An [[ref: issuer]] commitment via a signature to any variant of ACDC (compact, full, etc) makes a cryptographic commitment to the top-level section fields shared by all variants of that ACDC because the value of a [[ref: top-level-section]] is either the [[ref: SAD]] or the [[ref: SAID]] of the SAD of the associated section.
