[[def: Integrity]]

~ Integrity (of a message or data) means that the information is whole, sound, and unimpaired (not necessarily correct). It means nothing is missing from the information; it is complete and in intended good order.  
~ Source: Neil Thomson

~ ~In KERI's "security first" approach Authenticity includes _technical integrity_ of data involved. This includes:
~ 1. [[ref:internal-inconsistency]]
~ 2. External consistency or [[ref:duplicity]] evident

~ Note: Integrity in ACDCs is "self-verifying": the [[ref:self-addressing-identifier)]] that is contained in the data is also the of hash of the data.
