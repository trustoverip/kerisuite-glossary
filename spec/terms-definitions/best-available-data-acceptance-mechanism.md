~ The BADA security model provides a degree of [[ref: replay-attack]] protection. The attributate originator (issuer, author, source) is provided by an attached signature couple or quadruple.

When used as an [[ref: authorization]] the reply attributes may include the identifier of the authorizer and the logic for processing the associated route may require a matching attachment.
