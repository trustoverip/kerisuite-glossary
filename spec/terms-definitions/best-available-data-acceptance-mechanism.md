~ The BADA security model provides a degree of [[ref: replay-attack]] protection. The attributate originator (issuer, author, source) is provided by an attached signature couple or quadruple. A single reply could have multiple originators. When used as an [[ref: authorization]] the reply attributes may include the identifier of the authorizer and the logic for processing the associated route may require a matching attachment.
~ BADA is part of [[ref: KERI]]'s [Zero Trust Computing Architecture for Data Management](https://hackmd.io/Qsrfj7Y-TIGl5ESvrxWGxw): How to support Secure Async Data Flow Routing in KERI enabled Applications.
