[[def: graduated-disclosure, graduated disclosure]]

~ a disclosure of an [[ref: ACDC]] that does not reveal its entire content in the initial interaction with the recipient and, instead, partially or selectively reveals only the information contained within the ACDC necessary to further a transaction with the recipient. A Graduated disclosure may involve multiple steps where more information is progressively revealed as the recipient satisfies the conditions set by the [[ref: discloser]]. [[ref: compact-disclosure]], [[ref: partial-disclosure]], [[ref: selective-disclosure]], and [[ref: full-disclosure]] are all Graduated disclosure mechanisms.
