[[def: percolated-information-discovery, Percolated information discovery, PID]]

~ In the [[ref: OOBI]] protocol, a discovery mechanism for the [[ref: KERI]] and the [[ref: ACDC]] protocols is provided by a bootstrap that enables Percolated Information Discovery (PID), which is based on Invasion Percolation Theory.

~ After related information for discovery and verification is bootstrapped from the OOBI, subsequent authorization is non-interactive, thus making it highly scalable. This provides what we call zero-trust percolated discovery or speedy percolated discovery.
