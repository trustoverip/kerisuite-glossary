[[def: non-transferable-identifier, non-transferable-identifier]]

~ Controlling keys over this identifier cannot be rotated and therefore this identifier is [[ref: non-transferable]] to other control.  
~ An identifier of this type has specific positive features like short-lived, peer to peer, one-time use, discardable, etc. that are very practical in certain use cases. Moreover non-transferable identifiers are much easier to govern than persistent identifiers that are [[ref: transferable]].
