[[def: keridemlia, keridemlia]]

~ It is a contraction of [[ref: key-event-receipt-infrastructure]] and [Kademlia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia). It's the distributed database of Witness IP-addresses based on a [[ref: distributed-hash-table]]. It also does the CNAME - stuff that [[ref: domain-name]] Services (DNS) offers for KERI: the mapping between an identifier and it's controller AID stored in the KEL to its current wittness AID and the wittness AID to the IP address.
