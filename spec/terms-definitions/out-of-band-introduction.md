[[def: out-of-band-introduction, out-of-band introduction]]

~ Out-of-band Introductions (OOBIs) are discovery and validation of IP resources for [[ref: key-event-receipt-infrastructure]] autonomic identifiers. **Discovery via URI, trust via KERI.**

~ The simplest form of a KERI OOBI is a namespaced string, a tuple, a mapping, a structured message, or structured attachment that contains both a KERI AID and a URL. The OOBI associates the URL with the AID.
