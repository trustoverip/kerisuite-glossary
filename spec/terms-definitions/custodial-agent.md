[[def: custodial-agent, custodial agent]]

~ An [[ref: agent]] owned by an individual who has granted [[ref: signing-authority]] to a custodian who is usually also the host of the running agent software. Using [[ref: partial-rotation]] to facilitate custodial key management the owner of the identifier retains [[ref: rotation-authority]] and thus the ability to "fire" the custodian at any time without requiring the cooperation of the custodian.
