[[def: routed-exchange-message, Routed exchange message]]

~ is a KERI protocol message that allows one controller (sender) to transmit a confidential message to another controller (receiver) through one or more intermediaries (routers), while preserving authenticity (non-repudiation) and enabling confidentiality (through encryption), but potentially sacrificing privacy depending on routing visibility.
