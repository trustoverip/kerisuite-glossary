[[def: partial-rotation, Partial rotation]]

~ The pre-rotation mechanism supports partial pre-rotation or **more exactly partial rotation of pre-rotated keypairs**. It's a rotation operation on a set of pre-rotated keys that may keep some keys in reserve (i.e unexposed) while exposing others as needed.
