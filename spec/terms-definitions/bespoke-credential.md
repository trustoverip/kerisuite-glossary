[[def: bespoke-credential, Bespoke credential]]

~ It's an [[ref: issuance-event]] of the disclosure or presentation of other ACDCs. _Bespoke_ means _Custom_ or _tailor made_.
~ A bespoke credential serves as an on-the-fly contract with the issuee; it's a self-referencing and self-contained contract between the issuer and the verifier. Mind you, here the issuer and issuee are merely the discloser and disclosee of another (set of) ACDC(s).
